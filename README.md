## Single page web app

This is an exploratory task.

I have created a simple sinatra app that
- has one page with a button.
- You can click the button and data from `https://async-workshops-api.herokuapp.com/people` shows up on the page without refreshing.

Public interface button component tested with capybara testing framework
